# Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) is a cloud-based blockchain service for enterprises to build Blockchain-based solutions. Blockchain as a Service model allows users and enterprises to build and run their blockchain nodes on the public/private cloud. Blockchain as a Service is capable of creating new blockchain nodes, cryptographically store data on blocks of the blockchain, send and receive cyber coins/tokens, check wallet balances, validate transactions, broadcast new transactions among peers and develop a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. All blockchain services are accessible via the REST API which can be accessed using GET and POST requests. Deploy this full-stack application for developers, consumers, and enterprises onto the public/private cloud.

This project contains the following functionality:

•	One-click blockchain node configuration is available on any public/private cloud server.
•	Ability to create new blocks in the blockchain.
•	Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.
•	Blockchain holds all the transactions/data in the form of a shared ledger.
•	Ability to store any consumer’s data securely.
•	Ability to send cryptocurrency.
•	Ability to prevent double-spending transactions.
•	Ability to synchronize with other nodes via peer-to-peer communication using Publisher/Subscriber methodology.
•	Ability to create a new public/private key pairs (wallet address) for a new user/node.
•	Wallet owners can send or receive coins.
•	Users can check any wallet’s balance using the wallet’s public key.
•	Ability to autonomously validate blocks using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.
•	Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.
•	Every node can mine transaction using the proof-of-work algorithm.      
•	Every blockchain operations are bind with an API.
•	Ability to connect to other nodes via the internet.
